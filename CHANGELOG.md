# Changelog

## 0.4.0-alpha.5 — Structured Map Compiler & Command Audit

- Replaces raster-first normal terrain promotion with a structured PPTX-authored terrain manifest for Pavia.
- Uses PowerPoint object descriptions and geometry as the primary battlefield source; SVG and PDF are validation/rendering sources.
- Bundled Pavia compiler recognizes authored Marsh, Woods, Roads, Streams, Park Walls, Gates, tree lines, Bridges, built-up areas and Earthworks while excluding explicitly decorative building artwork.
- Terrain review highlights the exact compiled polygon/polyline geometry instead of feature bounding boxes.
- Approved terrain geometry is consumed directly by the browser playtest engine.
- Adds geometry-aware point/line terrain queries and open-crossing bridge overrides.
- Adds Impassable-terrain movement blocking to the browser adapter.
- Moves raster/appearance detection to Geometry Explorer-only fallback duty.
- Adds local in-browser PPTX metadata inventory on Map Intake.
- Audits command rules: command-specific 3-inch bonus, general 4-inch bonus, explicit post-activation commander movement up to 4 inches, enemy-distance restriction, and command-coverage logging.
- Preserves Scenario Builder, deployment polygons, external AI bridge, deterministic playtesting, replay and heat maps from alpha.4.
